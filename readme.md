# Sparta

This is basic JavaScript educational project.
<br><br>
Sparta let user play with animated GIF from solid picture to shattered vertical bars stil displaying GIF but with graphic impression of 3D blocks.

`Specific use depending on web purpose, definitely not for all designs.`
<br><br>

### Future developement ideas:

- extending time applying different animation movements to particular pieces of picture
- introduce loop and interactive responce for mouseover / click, more like long playing banner
  <br><br>

### Credits:

- inspiration based on Brad Traversy's [tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days/tree/master/3d-boxes-background)
